The underlying mechanistic model create a habitat suitability index based off remotely sensed habitat variables in a users area of interest. The relationship between some of these parameters and the habitat suitablity can be changed by the user in the InVEST workbench, others the users can define.\n\nTo get started the inputs needs to be in a project folder. Details on how to build these inputs for yourself are in [future tutorial link]{style=\"color: red;\"}. For the purpose of this tutorial we are going to use the Senegal sample data available on [Google Drive]() in `senegal_inputs.zip`. Download and unzip the file to your project folder. More details on how to download and unzip are provided in [Running sample models](../tutorials/02_sample_data/index.qmd). For this tutorial you don't need the `invest_schistosomiasis_senegal_datastack` folder or to load the `.json` file as described in the other tutorial. We are going to specify the parameters ourselves and create our own `.json` run files.  \n\n## Workbench  \n\n![Screenshot of workbench](plugin_blank.png){width=600}\n\nWhen first opened the Schistosomiasis plugin looks like this. Each of the red boxes require an input from the user. Short descriptions of these are provided by clicking the &#128712; icons. Details on how to fill the red boxes and the underlying functions are detailed below. \n\n### Workspace (directory)  \n\nThe workspace is the folder where all the model's output files will be written. If this folder does not exist, it will be created. If data already exists in the folder, it will be overwritten.  \n\nClick the `folder icon`, then navigate to where you want the model to be saved. In the screenshot I am saving it to a folder called `senegal_example_inputs`. Click `Select Folder` and the box will now contain the path to that folder.\\\n![screenshot setting up workspace](01_workspace.png){width=600}\n\n### File Suffix (string, optional)  \n\nOption to add a suffix to model outputs to help keep track of different run. I'm using today's date as a sting YYYYMMDD (20260205) so the runs will be saved in order.  \n\n### Area Of Interest (vector)  \n\nThe Area of Interest (AOI) is a polygon of the area where you want the predictions and have the input data. For this example the AOI is the Senegal River Basin and the shapefile was provided in the `senegal_inputs` folder downloaded from Google Drive.  \n\nClick the `folder icon`, navigate the `senegal_inputs/projected_sen_aoi.gpkg`, and click `Open`. Use this same process to load all of the files described below.  \n\nHere is what the AOI for the Senegal River Basin sample data looks like.\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Max decay distance (number) (m)\n\nThe maximum threat distance from water risk in meters The risk decays 1 $\\to$ 0 from 1km from water to the input max distance to water value linearly. *How far from water do you expect a population to be impacted?* \n\nThe function for proximity to water was based on a combination of literature and expert opinion. Households near schistosome-containing water bodies tend to have higher schistosomiasis prevalence than those far away ([Huang and Manderson 1992](https://doi.org/10.1016/0001-706x(92)90037-x)). This relationship has been studied in Kenya, Ghana and Brazil and summarized into four risk categories based on a residence’s proximity to freshwater: very high (<100 m), high (101-500 m), low (501-1,000 m) and very low (1,001-2,000 m) ([Ajakaye et al. 2017](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0005733)). Based on field experience, people living in the arid Senegal River Basin travel farther to water (personal communication with Giulio De Leo and Andy Chamberlin), so the risk categories at this site were scaled up to: total (<1 km), linearly declining (1-15 km), and negligible (>15 km). This categorization is supported by a study in Kenya which found no correlation between proximity and prevalence for schools within 1 km of water ([Nagi et al. 2014](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0002991)).\n\nEssentially, in northern Senegal surface water is quite limited (Sahel Desert) so we expect people to travel quite far to access water points. Therefore, 5 km (5000m) is a reasonable estimate for maximum distance (`max decay distance = 5000`).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Water Presence (raster)  \nA raster indicating presence of water called `senegal_inputs/projected_basin_water_mask_nodata_sen.tif` in the sample data. The water mask data here is based on [Andy add citation]{style=\"color: red;\"} and shows water presence/absenece in 30x30 meter pixels. The water mask is potentially the most important part of the model as risk will be underestimated for an area if the water presence raster indicates there is no water, but in truth small water bodies are present. Notice in the plot the Senegal river, which runs along the Mauritania-Senegal boarder and Lac de Guiers are clearly shown.  \n\n[I can change this to be interactive so the user and zoom in and see small water pixels]{style=\"color: red;\"}\n\n\n\n\n### Population \n\n#### Population Raster (raster) (m)  \n\n[Why is there an \"m\" in this title?]{style=\"color: red;\"}  \n\nA raster representing the number of inhabitants per pixel called `senegal_inputs/population_count_projected.tif`. The population data in this tutorial is from [Andy add citation]{style=\"color: red;\"} and shows the population estimates in ~1km pixels from [YEAR]{style=\"color: red;\"}. The population estimates are used to estimate the convoluted/population at risk estimates. It's a bit hard to see because most of Senegal has a low population density, but Saint Louis (coast directly left of AOI) has a much higher population estimate. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npbase +\n  geom_spatraster(data=popu)+\n  scale_fill_fermenter(na.value = \"transparent\")+\n  geom_spatvector(data=aoi, color=\"red\", fill=\"transparent\", lwd=1)+\n  geom_text(aes(x=(xmin(aoi)+7e4), y=ymin(aoi)+5e4, label=\"AOI\"), size=8)+\n  labs(fill=\"population\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Use Default Population Suitability (optional)\n\n[population is misspelled!]{style=\"color: red;\"} \n\nSlide bar with the option to Use the Default Population Suitability (slide right) or input your own function (slide left).

These values are based on at what respective population density you expect risk to be highest (1; rural) and lowest (0; urban). [Andy confirm this:]{style=\"color: red;\"} We estimated these values based on our local knowledge of at what population density transmission is highest before WASH measure are implemented and our estimate at which population density people are not exposed to surface water around their homes (e.g. city with piped water and plumbing).  \n \n#### Don't Use Default Population Suitability (optional)  \n\nIf the default option is not used the function and parameters need to be provided.  \n![screenshot of not default population suitabilty](pop_suitability_nodefault.png)  \\\n\nThe `Suitability Function Type` needs to be defined for both `Rural` and `Urbanization` using the drop down menus.

We used monthly water extent from JRC Monthly Water History v1.3 for a composite of 37 years from 1984 to 2021 because it is both open-source and accurate. Based on this we determined the best month to represent each season:  \n\n* May to represent the dry season. (Although March and April have lower precipitation, May has the lowest water extent. June is the first month with low but significant rainfall.)  \n* October to represent the wet season. (Although September has the highest precipitation, October has a slightly higher water extent.)\n\nTo avoid overestimation of water extent based on anomamlous years, the mask will include pixels that have had water in at least five of the past 37 years.\n\n#### Snail Water Temp Dry & Wet Risk  \n\nA ratio [0,1] of the temperature associated risk to snails in the dry and wet seasons. \n\nFor the tutorial set both of these to `1`. \n\n#### Snail Suitabililty Function Types  \n\nHere is where you choose the snail of interest and thus which species of Schistosoma the model is for. Remember *Bulinus truncatus* $\\to$ *S. haematobium* and *Biomphalaria* $\\to$ *S. mansoni*. The different snail genera have different thermal envelopes thus this will change the risk-temperature relationship. Alternatively, a function (linear, exponential, scurve, trapazoidal, gaussian) with the parameters decribed above can be used. \n\nAgain, set the `Risk weight` in the model for these parameters to `1`. \n\nFor the tutorial chose `Default: Bulinus truncatus` and `Default: S. haematobium`.  \n\nThe two snail temperature production functions in [Waltz et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0004217) are problematic because they do not have a maximum suitability of 1. Because we have an separate function for scalling down the impact of water temperature (`Risk`) we revised the function to not scale the effect twice. We based the revised temperature effects on the snail mortality reported in the original sources: [Pflüger 1980](https://doi.org/10.1007/bf00927532_) for Bimophalaria and [Pflüger et al. 1984](https://doi.org/10.1007/bf00929579) for Bulinus.\n\nBiomphalaria temperature production function: \n$$\n\\text{Value} = \\begin{cases} \n0 & \\text{if } Temp < 16 \\\\ \n-29.9111 + 5.015Temp + -0.3107Temp^2 +8.560e^{-03}Temp^3 + -8.769e^{-05}Temp^4 & \\text{if } 16 \\le Temp \\le 35 \\\\ \n0 & \\text{if } Temp > 35 \n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata.frame(Temp=seq(10,40, by=1)) %>% \n  mutate(y=case_when(Temp<16 ~ 0,\n                     Temp<=35 ~ -29.9111 + 5.015e+00 * Temp + -3.107e-01 * Temp^2 +8.560e-03 * Temp^3 + -8.769e-05 * Temp^4, \n                     TRUE ~ 0)) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x=Temp, y=y))+\n  geom_line()+\n  labs(title=\"Biomphalaria\",\n       x=\"Water surface temp C\",\n       y=\"Relative suitability\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nBulinus temperature production function:\n$$\n\\text{Value} = \\begin{cases} \n0 & \\text{if } Temp < 17 \\\\ \n-48.173 + 8.534 * Temp + -0.5568 * Temp^2 + 1.599e^{-02} * Temp^3 + -1.697e^{-04} * Temp^4 & \\text{if } 17 \\le Temp \\le 33 \\\\ \n0 & \\text{if } Temp > 33 \n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata.frame(Temp=seq(10,40, by=1)) %>% \n  mutate(y=case_when(Temp<17 ~ 0,\n                     Temp<=33 ~ -48.173 + 8.534e+00 * Temp + -5.568e-01 * Temp^2 + 1.599e-02 * Temp^3 + -1.697e-04 * Temp^4, \n                     TRUE ~ 0)) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x=Temp, y=y))+\n  geom_line()+\n  labs(title=\"Bulinus\",\n       x=\"Water surface temp C\",\n       y=\"Relative suitability\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nS. mansoni temperature production function:\n$$\n\\text{Value} = \\begin{cases} \n0 & \\text{if } Temp < 16 \\\\ \n-0.003 \\left(\\frac{268}{Temp - 14.2} - 335\\right) + 0.0336538 & \\text{if } 16 \\le Temp \\le 35 \\\\ \n0 & \\text{if } Temp > 35 \n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata.frame(Temp=seq(10,40, by=1)) %>% \n  mutate(y=case_when(Temp<16 ~ 0,\n                     Temp<=35 ~ -0.003 * (268/(Temp - 14.2) - 335) + 0.0336538, \n                     TRUE ~ 0)) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x=Temp, y=y))+\n  geom_line()+\n  labs(title=\"S. mansoni\",\n       x=\"Water surface temp C\",\n       y=\"Relative suitability\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nS. haematobium temperature production function \n$$\n\\text{Value} = \\begin{cases} \n0 & \\text{if } Temp < 17 \\\\ \n-0.006 \\left(\\frac{295}{Temp - 15.3} - 174\\right) + 0.056 & \\text{if } 17 \\le Temp \\le 33 \\\\ \n0 & \\text{if } Temp > 33 \n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata.frame(Temp=seq(10,40, by=1)) %>% \n  mutate(y=case_when(Temp<17 ~ 0,\n                     Temp<=33 ~ -0.006 * (295/(Temp - 15.3) - 174) + 0.056, \n                     TRUE ~ 0)) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x=Temp, y=y))+\n  geom_line()+\n  labs(title=\"S. haematobium\",\n       x=\"Water surface temp C\",\n       y=\"Relative suitability\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Calculate NDVI (optional) \n\n`Enable` and so that NDVI effects are calculated.

You should be able to drag and drop that into the model. To do so click on \"save as\" in the left menu (1) and select `Parameters only` and `Use relative paths` (2) then click `Save`. This opens a new window where you can give the file a good name (4) and click `Save`. Back in the InVEST workbench you'll see a brief `archeiving` message.\\   \n![screenshots to save datastack](save_datastack.png)\n\nThe run can then be loaded by (1) clicking `load parameters from file`, (2) click on the relevant `.tzg` folder with the name you gave it above, (4) click `Open`, (5) check you are in the folder above the folder with the files (in this case `senegal_inputs`) [only matters if you checked \"relative paths\" when you created the file], and (5) click `Extract archeive here`. \n\n![screenshots of loading saved run](load_saved_run.png) \n\nNow everything you previously input is loaded in the workspace.  \n\n\n## Just the tutorial inputs please!  \nEverything called a \"risk weight\" is how important (e.g., relative weight) that parameter is in the model.\n\n| Name | Description | Input |  \n| --- | ---| --- |   \n| Workspace | file where results are saved to | \"senegal_example_inputs\" |  \n| File Suffix | if you want to save many interations of the model in the same folder add a suffix e.g. the date) | \"20260205\" |    \n| Area of Interest | shape file of the area you want to model | \"senegal_inputs/projected_sen_aoi.gpkg\" |  \n| Max decay distance | How far from water (meters) are populations impacted | \"5000\" |  \n| Water Presence | Binary raster of water features | \"senegal_inputs/projected_basin_water_mask_nodata_sen.tif\" |  \n| Population Raster | A raster representing the number of inhabitants per pixel | `senegal_inputs/population_count_projected.tif` |  \n| Default Population Suitability | Population densities suitable to transmission | \"rural population max = 1000\" \\n \"urbanization population max = 25000\" |  \n| Calculate Water Depth | Function to estimate water depth based on dist. to shore | \"Enable\" \\n \"Risk weight = 1\" |  \n| Calculate Water Temperature | Function to estimate water temperature suitability | \"Enable\" |  \n| Dry Season Temperature Raster | Raster of air temperature in the dry season | \"senegal_inputs/projected_habsuit_waterTemp_dry_2019_sen.tif\" |  \n| Wet Season Temperature Raster | Raster of air temperature in the dry season | \"senegal_inputs/projected_habsuit_waterTemp_wet_2019_sen.tif\" |  \n| Snail Water Temp Dry Risk Weight |  | \"1\" |  \n| Snail Water Temp Wet Risk Weight |  | \"1\" |  \n| Snail Suitability Function Type | Which snail species to model | \"Default: Bulinus truncatus\" |  \n| Parasite Water Temp Dry Risk Weight |  | \"1\" |  \n| Parasite Water Temp Wet Risk Weight |  | \"1\" |  \n| Parasite Suitability Function Type | Which snail species to model | \"Default: S. haematobium\" |  \n| Calculate NDVI | Include NDVI in the model | \"Enable\" |  \n| Suitability Function Type | default or user specified relationship with risk and NDVI | \"Default used in paper\" |  \n| NDVI Dry Raster | Raster of NDVI (0,1) during the dry season | \"senegal_inputs/projected_habsuit_NDVI_dry_2019_sen.tif\" |  \n| NDVI Dry Risk Weight |  | \"1\" |  \n| NDVI Wet Raster | Raster of NDVI (0,1) during the wet season | \"senegal_inputs/projected_habsuit_NDVI_wet_2019_sen.tif\" |  \n| NDVI Wet Risk Weight |  | \"1\" |  \n| Calculate Water Velocity | Function to estimate water velocity suitability | \"Disable\" |  \n| Additional User Defined Suitabilty Input | Allows user to add additional custom functions | \"Disable\" |  \n\nhttps://github.com/Bushytop/schisto_eeid/tree/main/data/natcap_invest\nhttps://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Gj8zyo4nE2ij10aNuoXjx3yiYCTGy5tR?usp=sharing#scrollTo=dylSqiUUwmA8\n[7:52 AM]in particular, the parameters to use for consistency are:\nmax decay distance: 5000\nuse default population suitability (enable)\nrural population max: 1000\nurbanization population max: 25000\ncalculate water depth (enable)\nwater depth risk weight: 1\ncalculate water temperature (enable)\nall risk weights set to 1\ndefault snail and parasite suitability function types\ncalculate ndvi (enable)\ndefault ndvi suitability function\nndvi risk weight: 1 for both dry and wet\nwater velocity disabled and no other functions defined\n",
