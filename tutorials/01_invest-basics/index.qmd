InVEST has a wide range of capabilities that are well documented....

Here is what you need to know about InVEST to use the Schistosomiasis plugin.  

## 1. Downloading InVEST

The Schistosomiasis Tool is built on top of NatCap's InVEST Workbench software. Before using the tool, you will have to download InVEST Workbench. 

### 1a. Download instructions for Windows

* Windows users must confirm that the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable is installed. To check if you have the compiler installed you can:
  * Open 'Add or Remove Programs'
  * Search for 'C++'
  * You'll see something like 'Microsoft Visual 2015-2019 Redistributable..." 
  * If you don't see anything like that you'll need to install the compiler
* To install the compiler 
  * Go to [this link](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#microsoft-visual-c-redistributable-for-visual-studio-2022)
  * Download and install the 'Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio'

* Once the compiler is installed, download and install the InVEST workbench
  * Click the link to 'Download InVEST 3.17.1 Workbench (Windows)' on [this site](https://naturalcapitalproject.stanford.edu/software/invest/invest-downloads-data)

</div>
  
  * Once it's downloaded, run the installer. Select 'Install for this user only' and open Workbench
  * Close and update or changelog windows on startup

### 1b. Download instructions for Mac
* Check your MacOS version. Different versions of macOS require different minimum InVEST versions:
  * macOS 10.13 High Sierra → requires InVEST 3.4.0 or later
  * macOS 11 Big Sur → requires InVEST 3.9.0 or later
* Download the InVEST Workbench. 
  * Click the link to 'Download InVEST 3.17.1 Workbench (Mac)' on [this site](https://naturalcapitalproject.stanford.edu/software/invest/invest-downloads-data)
  
    <div style="text-align: center;">

* IMPORTANT: Launch InVEST for the First Time. MacOS security will block the app on first launch. To allow it:
  * Open Applications  
  * Right-click the InVEST app → choose Open
  
   <div style="text-align: center;">

  * In the popup, click 'Done' (the app will not open yet)

  * Open Applications → System Settings → Privacy & Security

</div>
  
  * Scroll to the Security section — you should see: 'InVEST <version> Workbench was blocked to protect your Mac.' Click 'Open Anyway'. 
  
       <div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="tutorial screenshots/Screenshot7.png" width="500">

</div>
  
  * Click 'Open Anyway' again on the pop up box.

  * Enter your Mac username + password when prompted. 
  
       <div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

After this, the InVEST Workbench will start. This approval is only needed the first time.

## 2. Downloading the Schistosomiasis Plug-in

Once InVEST Workbench is succesfully downloaded, you will need to open it and add the Schistosomiasis Plug-in to use the Schistosomiasis Tool. 

* Open InVEST Workbench. In InVEST Workbench click the three line menu icon → Manage Plugins → Add Plugin.

     <div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="tutorial screenshots/Screenshot10.png" width="600">
  <p><em>Screenshot showing where to manage plug-ins</em></p>
</div>

* Copy and paste and insert the following for git URL: https://github.com/natcap/invest-schistosomiasis.git. Check the box to acknowledge the risks associated with installing the plugin. Leave everything else blank.Click 'Add'. This step will take several minutes. It is setting up an isolated python environment, downloading, and installing the schistosomiasis model. You only need to do this step once.

</div>

* To check that the plug-in was successfully installed, go to XXX and open it. 

## 3. Downloading sample data

Now that InVEST Workbench and the Schistosomiasis Plug-in are installed, you will need sample data to run the model. We have provided sample data for CIV, Senegal, and Tanzania. 

* Zipped files containing the sample data can be downloaded from a Google Drive folder linked [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lVnXvhtyNA9mAIwBPTD0HgFQELPkHs0V)
* For each location, there are two files:
  * invest_schistosomiasis_[location]_datastack.tar.gz contain InVEST datastack archives (a zipped tarball containing all model inputs and parameters). The data in these files will populate the inputs for the Schistosomiasis Tool. 
  * [location]_inputs.zip contain all the inputs for each location, including the different AOI (Area of Interest - the geographic boundary defining the study region)
* Download the two files for the location you are interested in running
* Once files are downloaded, extract them (unzip them). 
* When extracted, you should see a parameters.invest.json file
* Drag parameters.invest.json into the InVEST model window to auto-fill all inputs

## 4. Running the model with sample data

* Open the Schistosomiasis model in Workbench.
* Drag parameters.invest.json into the UI.
* Choose an output folder.
* Click Run.
