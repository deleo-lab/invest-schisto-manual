## Downloading InVEST

The Schistosomiasis Tool is built on top of NatCap's InVEST Workbench software. Before using the tool, you will have to download InVEST Workbench.

We've created a **custom version InVEST** to support the custom functionality needed for the schistosomiasis model. When users download InVEST to run the schistosomiasis plugin, they will be using this custom version of InVEST. In the future this might not be necessary and users can use regular InVEST for the schisto plugin, but the following custom functionality makes it necessary at the moment.

### Windows

1.  Windows users must confirm that the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable is installed. To check if you have the compiler installed you can:
    a.  Open `Add or Remove Programs` in `Settings \> Apps \> Installed apps`
    b.  Search for `C++`
    c.  You'll see something like `Microsoft Visual 2015-2019 Redistributable...`

   f. The InVEST Workbench will now start as usual. This approval is only needed the first time.

## Installing the Schistosomiasis Plug-in

Once InVEST Workbench is downloaded, you will need to open it and add the Schistosomiasis Plug-in to use the Schistosomiasis Tool.

1.  Open InVEST Workbench. In InVEST Workbench click the `three line menu icon` $\to$ `Manage Plugins` $\to$ `Add Plugin`.\

2.  Copy and paste the following for git URL: **`https://github.com/natcap/invest-schistosomiasis.git`**. Check the box to acknowledge the risks associated with installing the plugin. Leave everything else blank. Click `Add`. This step will take several minutes. It is setting up an isolated python environment, downloading, and installing the schistosomiasis model. You only need to do this step once.\
