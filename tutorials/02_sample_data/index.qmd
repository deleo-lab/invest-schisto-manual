## Downloading sample data

Now that InVEST Workbench and the Schistosomiasis Plug-in are installed, you will need sample data to run the model. We have provided sample data for Cote d'Ivoire (CIV), Senegal, and Tanzania.

Zipped files containing the sample data can be downloaded from a Google Drive folder linked [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lVnXvhtyNA9mAIwBPTD0HgFQELPkHs0V). [currently need to ask for access!]{style="color: red;"}. For each location, there are two files:

1. `invest_schistosomiasis\_\[location\]\_datastack.tar.gz` contain InVEST datastack archives (a zipped tarball containing all model inputs and parameters). The data in these files will populate the inputs for the Schistosomiasis Tool.  
2. `\[location\]\_inputs.zip` contain all the inputs for each location, including the different AOI (Area of Interest - the geographic boundary defining the study region)
    
### Move data into InVEST  

1. Download the two files for the location you are interested in running from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lVnXvhtyNA9mAIwBPTD0HgFQELPkHs0V) [currently need to ask for access!]{style="color: red;"}
2. Once files are downloaded, extract them (unzip them). Store them in a folder relevant to your project (e.g. `Invest_sample_data/Schistosomiasis/Senegal`)\

3. Open `InVEST` and then click `Schistosomiasis` to open the plugin.\

3. In your file browser navigate to where you extracted the `invest_schistosomiasis_senegal_datastack` folder. In that folder there is a file `parameters.invest.json`.
4. Drag parameters.invest.json into the InVEST model window to auto-fill all inputs. Alternatively you can open the file using `Load parameters from file` and navigating to `parameters.invest.json`

## Running the model with sample data

-   Open the Schistosomiasis model in Workbench.
-   Drag parameters.invest.json into the UI.
-   Choose an output folder.
-   Click Run.
