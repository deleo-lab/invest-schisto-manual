The goal of the Schistosomiasis plugin for the InVEST software is provide a tool to incorporate schistosomiasis risk into dam and water infrastructure development decisions. This work is based on the [Walz et al. 2015](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0004217) paper with additional contributions by Andy Chamberlain and Giulio De Leo from the De Leo Lab, and Lisa Mandle and Doug Denu from the Natural Capital Project.
