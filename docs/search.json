Download instructions for Windows\n\nWindows users must confirm that the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable is installed. To check if you have the compiler installed you can:\n\nOpen ‘Add or Remove Programs’\nSearch for ‘C++’\nYou’ll see something like ’Microsoft Visual 2015-2019 Redistributable…”\nIf you don’t see anything like that you’ll need to install the compiler\n\nTo install the compiler\n\nGo to this link\nDownload and install the ‘Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio’\n\nOnce the compiler is installed, download and install the InVEST workbench\n\nClick the link to ‘Download InVEST 3.17.1 Workbench (Windows)’ on this site\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot showing download link\n\n\n\nOnce it’s downloaded, run the installer.

The data in these files will populate the inputs for the Schistosomiasis Tool.\n[location]_inputs.zip contain all the inputs for each location, including the different AOI (I don’t know what this means)\n\nDownload the two files for the location you are interested in running\nOnce files are downloaded, extract them (unzip them).\nWhen extracted, you should see a parameters.invest.json file\nDrag parameters.invest.json into the InVEST model window to auto-fill all inputs"
